# APIC-EM
Scripts to manipulate the APIC-EM Sandbox from Cisco

This is a script that allows you to connect to any APIC-EM server and pull data based on the APIs.  It then prints the data in an easy to read format.

It is recommend to go to learninglabs.cisco.com and go through a few labs for the APIC-EM to see how it works.  This script just takes those labs and builds upon it.
